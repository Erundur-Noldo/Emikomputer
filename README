TO COMPILE THE EMULATOR:
gcc -o emulator/main emulator/main.c emulator/cpu.c emulator/im.c emulator/module.c

TO COMPILE THE ASSEMBLER:
gcc -o assembler/assembler assembler/assembler.c

TO ASSEMBLE A PROGRAM FROM BINARY:
./assembler/assembler ./programs/[name of program]

TO RUN A PROGRAM:
./emulator/main out
./emulator/main out r   ((prints the registers after running the program))
./emulator/main out i   ((prints each performed instruction))
./emulator/main out a   ((prints both registers and instructions))
