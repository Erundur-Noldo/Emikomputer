an instruction to have the ALU be activated without updating flags

ALU modes I might wanna add and replace something else by them, or expand the ALU somehow:

add with carry
sub with borrow
inverted sub (b-a instead of a-b)
inverted sub with borrow
multiplication (high 8 bits)
multiplication (low 8 bits)



improve the code :3
make the assembler less shitty
rewrite the module functions to better represent the redesigned module communication protocol

write more programs in assembly :v

write a compiler!! :o
